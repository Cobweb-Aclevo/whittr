Whittr Community Guidelines and End-User license agreement.
</h1>
<p>
We at Whittr believe that communication is vital. It’s amazing to see so many communities and people use this application to converse and Whittr with one another and allow those to find new friends.
<br><br>
The overwhelming majority of people use Whittr responsibly, so these guidelines may seem obvious. Still we want to be clear about the expectations for users.

Do not make threats of violence or threaten to harm others.  <br> This includes indirect threats, as well as sharing or threatening to share someone’s private personal information (also known as doxxing). <br><br>
Do not send others viruses or malware, attempt to phish others, or hack or DDoS them.
You may not share sexually explicit information. <br> Pornography of any kind should not, and will not, be shared on Whittr. <br><br>
