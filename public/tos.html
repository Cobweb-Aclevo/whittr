      INTRODUCTION AND ACCEPTING THE TERMS <br>
      Welcome to Whittr! These Terms of Service are a legal agreement between Whittr. and its related companies (the
      “Company,” “us,” “our,” or "we") and you ("you" or “your”). By using or accessing the Whittr application (the
      “App”) or the website located at http://whittr.xyz and/or https://whittr.xyz (the "Site"), which are collectively
      referred to as the “Service,” you agree (i) that you are 13 years of age and the minimum age of digital consent in
      your country, (ii) if you are the age of majority in your jurisdiction or over, that you have read, understood,
      and accept to be bound by the Terms, and (iii) if you are between 13 (or the minimum age of digital consent, as
      applicable) and the age of majority in your jurisdiction, that your legal guardian has reviewed and agrees to
      these Terms.
      The Company reserves the right to update these Terms, which we may do for reasons that include, but are not
      limited to, complying with changes to the law or reflecting enhancements to Whittr. Unless we state otherwise,
      your continued use of the Service after we post modifications will constitute your acceptance of and agreement to
      those changes. If you object to the changes, your recourse shall be to cease using the Service. <br><br>

      RIGHTS TO USE THE SERVICE<br>
      The Service provides a chat and social platform. The Service may allow you to participate in chat rooms and
      voice/video communications and to utilize messaging features to communicate with other users of the Service.
      Subject to your compliance with these Terms, the Company grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive,

      to) (i) use the Service for any use or purpose other than as expressly permitted by these Terms;(ii) copy, adapt,
      modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, sell, transfer, publicly display, publicly

      disassemble, or otherwise exploit the Service or any portion of the Service, except as expressly permitted in
      these Terms; or (iii) use data mining, robots, spiders, or similar data gathering and extraction tools on the
      Service. No licenses or rights are granted to you by implication or otherwise under any intellectual property
      rights owned or controlled by the Company or its licensors, except for the permissions and rights expressly
      granted in these Terms.
      The Company reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part
      thereof) with or without notice. The Company reserves the right to refuse any user access to the Services without
      notice for any reason, including but not limited to a violation of the Terms. If you violate these Terms, the
      Company reserves the right to issue you a warning regarding the violation or immediately terminate or suspend any

      suspending your connection, but it may do so.

      activity on the Service. Upon launching the App or the Service you will be asked to provide a username or
      pseudonym of your choosing and a room-name. We reserve the right to log IP addresses, and ban users through IP
      blocking, as we see fit. You represent and warrant that the information you provide to us upon registration and at
      all other times will be true, accurate, current, and complete. We reserve the right to reject any username or to
      terminate your username or prevent use of a username in our sole discretion, and without any liability to you. You
      understand and agree that other users of the Service may have the same username as you. You agree that we will not
      be liable for any loss or damage arising from unauthorized use of your credentials or username.

      Channels at any time, without notice, for any reason. You acknowledge that any user content (including without
      limitation chats, postings, or materials posted by users) on the Communication Channels or video conferencing is
      neither endorsed nor controlled by us. The Company will not under any circumstances be liable for any activity
